# Examples

These examples are small, self-contained scenarios you can use to test Drift Guardian locally.

- `docs-drift/` shows documentation drift between README/docs and code.
- `logic-drift/` shows a policy contradiction between billing code and terms.
- `realworld-api/` shows REST + GraphQL + WebSocket + CLI drift patterns.
- `realworld-policy/` shows deterministic comparisons against a refund policy.
